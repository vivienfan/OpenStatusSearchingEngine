This program has very specific input and output that can only be used by Siemens Building Technology commercial department.
It takes input from CheckBox 1 and 2, multiple DriveListBoxes, DirListBoxes and FileListBoxes, and CommandButton 1, 2, 3 and 4.
These are setups for searching options, output options and file locations (which are set to some specific directory initially).
The program can either output the number of cases onto the main window in Frame 1 and 2, or output the detailed case information in an additoinal Excel file and open it, or save it onto desktop.
